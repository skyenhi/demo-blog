        <h3>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM SEMI-PRIVATE TRAINING</h3>
        <p>Small Group training is available for those individuals who are interested in the individual attention and custom programming of personal training, and by sharing the experience with a friend or colleague, each of you receives a cost savings. By training with your spouse, friend, colleague or housemate you can benefit from the camaraderie and motivation of having a partner with you during your workouts. Having the support of a training partner is a fun and easy way to ensure motivation to program adherence and ultimately, your success!</p>
        <h4>Top Reasons to train with friends/in small-groups</h4>
        <ul class="list-decimal">
          <li><i>Accountability</i> – Showing up is half the battle! By having a partner, or group of friends join you on your fitness journey, you make a commitment to yourself and your comrades that you will show up and give it your all, no excuses!</li>
          <li><i>Personalized</i> – As with all personal training programs, we will begin with a personal investigation, taking an inventory of exercise history, goals, interests, fears, abilities and limitations so that we can craft a personal program tailored to the clients’ fitness level.</li>
          <li><i>Variety</i> – No two sessions will ever the same. Having a partner in your training sessions allows for greater variety in programing where you will benefit from the supportive atmosphere of a team.</li>
          <li><i>Technique</i> – Working with a trainer privately or semi-privately ensures that you are learning the proper technique in order to ensure your safety and optimally build progression.</li>
          <li><i>Flexible Scheduling</i> – Want to workout over your lunch break? In the early morning? In your home? Outside? My clients’ success is important to me, therefore I make it a goal to create programming that accommodates busy schedules.</li>
          <li><i>Fun & Exciting</i> – My passion lies in making fitness fun for everyone. Let’ face it, if exercising feels like a chore, you’re not likely going to want to workout. It’s a lot easier to get fit and healthy if you’re having fun in your workouts. Training with a friend or two or three allows you the opportunity to smile while you sweat. Let me customize a program for you and your friends that has maximum fun for maximum benefit!</li>
          <li><i>Results</i> – Research shows that people who workout with a partner or in groups are more likely to stick with their program and have a positive experience. This translates to results when it means you’re more likely to stick with it and challenge each other to work harder. You’ll have not only the support from a knowledgeable trainer, but also the support from someone who’s on the journey with you. We set up the right environment for results to happen naturally.</li>
